Going back to my personal website [ricochenx.com](http://ricochenx.com/){:target="_blank"} after having something to show in the portfolio section, I spent a good amount of time styling and fixing the layout of my site. Mainly on the portfolio section to keep it 100 viewport and make the cards look right. There are still some things I need to fix for the thesis and greenfield project to make them more intuitive in the live site for users. I also fixed up my linkedin and resume to prepare for the job search. Other than that, my online presence is complete and all that's left to do is prepare for interviews!
