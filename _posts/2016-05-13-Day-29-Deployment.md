Nearing the end of a full stack application, the next concept to learn is deployment and task runners. Having built out the frontend, backend, database, and authentication for the shortly app, which is a clone of Bitly, it's now time to deploy it for the public to use. The platform I'm using is Heroku, a cloud platform with easy to use commands and is free for a certain number of apps. It has GitHub integration, which means git commands like add, commit, and push can all be used with the Heroku repo, and production ready code can be implemented to the live application simply by pushing.<br />
Grunt, a JavaScript task runner, can and does a whole lot of things, but to summarize it in one word, it provides automation. It solves the problem of doing repetitive tasks such as minification, compilation, and unit testing through configuration. All it takes is a simple command in the command line, and Grunt will perform the tasks it was assigned to do. Grunt automates a lot of the tedious work a developer has to do, allowing them to focus on other tasks and ultimately improving efficiency. It is just as simple to learn as Heroku and spending time to learn it now, can save an enormous amount of time and debugging in the future.
