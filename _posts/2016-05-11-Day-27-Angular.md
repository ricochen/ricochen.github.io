Oh yeah, it's time to dive into the popular front end framework Angular. There is a long standing battle between React and Angular, but lucky for me I get to learn both! Angular is an MV* framework that has two way data binding, synchronizing the model with the view. When a user interacts with the interface, the logic in the model is executed and the DOM gets updated automagically (that's how some people actually described it). The reverse is true as well, if the model gets updated, the view is re-rendered.<br />
It is best for single page web apps because instead of reloading the page, it uses routes that redirect the user to that route and renders that template. Angular also makes connecting HTML and JavaScript a breeze by extending HTML's syntax to express application components. $scope in Angular is a component that ties the controller and view together. Angular's built in Dependency Injection relieves hard coding dependencies within a component and instead components are simply given their dependencies.<br />
In short, Angular is pretty awesome and achieves a lot of functionality in little code.
