Backbone is the first framework I've learned, and I really like the concept, but implementing it is another story. It is difficult to piece together all of the views, models, and collections and understanding which events, listeners, and functions link back to what. However, after finishing the MyTunes app, the design and architecture of backbone is a lot more apparent, and having a good understanding of an unopinionated framework like Backbone will make learning other frameworks a lot easier such as React and Angular.
