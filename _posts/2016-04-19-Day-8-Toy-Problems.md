title: "Toy Problems"

Today we had our first toy problem. They are coding challenges that require creating an algorithm to solve, and range in difficulty, although I think most of ours will be hard. There's going to be a toy problem everyday except Monday, which has the time slot reserved for self assessments.<br />
This brings back memories of when I practiced on coderbyte to get faster at algorithms, and to start thinking like a programmer. Algorithms, alongside data structures are one of my favorite topics.<br />
_Rock, paper, scissors permutation: Given a number of rounds n, return all the possible rock-paper-scissors play possibilities for that number of rounds._<br />
I'll leave that for you to solve (hint use recursion!)
