After today, we only have four more days to add features to the thesis project, then it's feature freeze. In feature freeze we are only allowed to do things like styling, write tests, and minor refactors. I'm pretty excited to see the finished app, hopefully by then we will have enough on the front-end for quality user experience. I finished the pie chart to show the 7 most common words alongside the search term the user inputs. I plan to improve it by including the percentage and number or occurrences as lines connected to the pie chart, and transitions to make it look cool.<br />
At the end of the day, I played Super Smash Bros 4 on the Wii U. A juinor brought his game console along with gamecube controllers. My favorite is Super Smash Bros Melee because of its fast pace and high skill cap. I used to play a lot in high school and practiced my tech skill in melee. Super Smash Bros 4 on the other hand is more like its predecessor brawl, but playing with the seniors, juinors and even fellows was fun. It makes me want to get back into playing melee and practice and even go to the weekly tournament held at The Foundry in SF.
