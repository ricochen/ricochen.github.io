Yay backend! I'm a big fan of server side development as its more algorithm and logic based. Not only do I get to mostly use JavaScript, but I get to work with data too, and working with databases is one of my favorite things to do. Actually, SQL was the first language I learned, until I picked up a programming language, and even after having learned JavaScript, I still think SQL is awesome.<br />
Remember the chatterbox client from a few sprints ago? This time, I'm going to be building out the backend portion of it using Node, and the RESTful HTTP requests I learned earlier except there's one more request: OPTIONS. OPTIONS usually operates behind the scenes, and is a one time authentication that either allows or doesn't allow the client to connect with the server. If it does, it remembers the connection for the session, and the client will then be able to send and receive data through POST and GET requests to the server.
