I can't believe it, but I got my first response today! The crazy thing is I applied earlier in the morning, and the company responded a few hours later saying they would like to do a phone interview with the hiring manager. I'm so excited, it's both a position and company that I would thoroughly enjoy working at. I've received some coding challenges as well, and am looking into sites like Hired.com. I'm looking forward to next week to hear back from more companies, and learning about them, as there are so many interesting companies out there.<br />
Alumni also came today, to do a Q&A panel similar to yesterday. They were a great deal of help and gave invaluable advice. Some of the things they mentioned were to always ask to pseudocode first, know how to answer common behavioral questions such as strengths and weaknesses, mostly big companies stress algorithms and data structures whereas startups may ask more about projects and design or specific JavaScript questions. They also said the algorithms weren't ridiculously hard most of the time, and none harder than the ones we've done at MakerSquare.
