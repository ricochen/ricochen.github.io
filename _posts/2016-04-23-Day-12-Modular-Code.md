Instead of making sure all the features work first, or continually adding functionality to an application, and then organize the code at the end. I really like the other way around, by starting off writing modular code and making sure it's separated and grouped correctly while adding functionality one by one. This makes it clearer what each function is used for, and where to go to fix a bug.<br />
On the other hand, if one were to write hundreds of lines of code that works functionally but has yet to be organized and put in modules, it can be really difficult to start trying to modularize. Changing blocks of code and moving them can cause some features to stop working, leading to additional time spent remaking features to work, when it could have been avoided if the code was modular in the first place.<br />
There's also the problem of finishing an app with unorganized code, and then coming back a week later to organize it and one forgets what some of the code does. When in doubt, use modules and write clean code the first time writing it, it'll pay off in the long run.
