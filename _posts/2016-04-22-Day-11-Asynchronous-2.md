Same as yesterday, the entire day was spent on this week long sprint. A lot of the work my partner and I did involved making correct ajax calls to the server to store data, and being able to retrieve that data on the front end. The reminder app we worked on had one functionality in which the user is able to delete a reminder through a delete button. This required dynamically removing the div element from the DOM, as well as deleting the data for this reminder from the server. One thing that stands out to me is I now have a much stronger understanding of how the front end is connected to the backend, and how to make a full stack application functional.
