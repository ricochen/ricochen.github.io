I've started reading CtCI, and have learned important tips regarding the interview process, such as always asking clarifying questions when first given an algorithm or data structure question. The first 80 or so pages talk about interviewing, behavioral questions, dress code, offer stages, and all that good stuff. Then the author goes right into technical questions, which make up most of the book. The technical questions are written in Java, but lucky for me its syntax is similar to JavaScript.<br />
I've gone through the first chapter of technical questions, Arrays and Lists and didn't have too much trouble. The next chapter is Linked Lists, which I will start tomorrow. I plan to post my solutions on GitHub, along with guidance on vital interview questions and best practices while whiteboarding.
