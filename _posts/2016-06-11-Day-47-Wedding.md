My friend's wedding is today, and I get a day off! I initially was going to go to MakerSquare and then leave after lunch to make it to the wedding, but realized it wouldn't have been worth the few hours. So I decided to work remote until it was time to get ready. I carpooled with my friends to San Jose, where the wedding was held, and the weather was blazing hot. The ceremony was quicker than I anticipated, only lasting a few hours, then we went to dinner. Dinner was buffet style, and by then I was beyond hungry. After dinner, everyone danced on the dance floor and before I knew it the night was over. It was a nice break from coding, and I also have tomorrow off as it's Sunday, but that's not going to stop me from getting better at React and Redux! #always be coding.
