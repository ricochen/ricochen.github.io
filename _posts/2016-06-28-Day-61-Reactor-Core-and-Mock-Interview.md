title: "Reactor Core and Mock Interview"

One of the executives from reactor core came to MakerSquare to inform us about the hiring team and company partners as next week is career week. There are a number of companies that are partnered with the reactor core network to connect with bootcamp grads. Although this is great, and will help during the job search, it is by no means a guaranteed job. Only if a candidate fits the skills needed for a position at a hiring partner company will they proceed; other candidates do not move on. Most of the companies are startups but there are a few brand names. I plan to make the best use of this resource but not depend too much on it, and spend most of my efforts looking for a job myself.<br />
I also did my mock interview today. It was fun! I really like technical questions. I see them as more of a challenging puzzle for me to solve or a way to show what I've learned. Being in an intense learning environment has also helped my nerves in interviews. I no longer get nervous when asked a question I don't know, instead I'm able to think through it using the knowledge I've accumulated. With that being said, I'm actually looking forward to the job search to prove I've come a long way since first learning programming.
