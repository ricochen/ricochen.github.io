Redux is a state container that goes great with React, and can be used in place of Flow. However, successfully using React and Redux together is challenging. To add on top of that, webpack is a tool that takes some time to learn as well as it also goes great with React. Basically, the strive to learn new technology never ends, as a few years from now another library may come out that overtakes React, Redux, or webpack. But that is the beauty of software engineering, constantly learning and adapting best practices as a developer.<br />
I thought using React wasn't going to be that difficult after reading all of the documentation. And it's not, but using it with Redux makes it way harder because of how opinionated they both are. Even after reading all of the Redux docs, I had trouble determining what kind of file structure to use, what logic should go where, and what renders which data. I ended up having the folders: actions, components, containers, and reducers. By using React and Redux, modularity and separation of concerns is easily solved, now I just have to use them together successfully.
