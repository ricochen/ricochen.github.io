Looks like I was wrong, getting 4 people to agree on an idea is harder than I thought! The good news is we agreed on the type of app to make, and what tech stack we will be using. As for the content, each member wanted something different, from using NASA's API to retrieve data on meteors to CO2 levels for cities.<br />
As for the app, our tech stack will be Angular for the front-end, and Express/Node for the back-end. We plan to have the user interact with the client side using speech to text, and using that text to make a GET request on the backend to an API. As for which API, which would be the content, we are still deciding.
