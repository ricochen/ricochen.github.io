title: "Salary Negotiation"

The important talk, and one that neither the employer nor candidate want to do, salary negotiations. The all important rule is to never give a number first. And always negotiate because the chance of a company rescinding an offer due to asking for a bit more is low, unless the amount asked is absurdly high. Just five minutes of negotiating and receiving more in an offer will compound future earnings. For example, person A negotiated and person B did not. Person A ends up with a $10,000 higher salary, and person B might think, oh it's just $10,000. But as the years pass, that $10,000 compounds and in 5 years it leads to $50,000 more at the minimum, without counting other factors such as raises and time value of money. So it's important to start at a salary that one desires through negotiation.<br />
Later in the night, the hiring team and a few partner companies came to speak with us. They did a Q&A panel and after had a short networking section. It's interesting to hear their advice, and some were definitely things I'll take into account. It seems coding challenges are really common, so there's a high chance I'll be doing several at a time.
