Okay, today is officially the last day for the seniors. They had career week this week and their graduation was today. Hugs were given, speeches were made, and drinks were served. We even played pictionary on the whiteboard and we had to guess what the seniors were drawing. The answers ranged from React to hashtable to duckling. The pair that won got a MakerSquare sweater!<br />
Besides senior graduation, so many other things were happening. We were going into solo week for the greenfield projects and today was the last day for the entire group to be physically together. Then we would work remotely. So we had to crank out a git workflow and functionalities for our app that we would work on.<br />
Another thing is juniors have their cumulative assessment tomorrow, which is basically a final to assess whether we can apply what we have learned. Instead of going with the seniors and fellows to karaoke after the graduation ceremony, which I really wanted to do because singing is one of my favorite hobbies, I decided to go home while the night was young to study a bit and get enough sleep. Hopefully I made the right decision.
