Library #1379, we used react-materialize in our app for styling. The documentation was simple and easy to use, so there was really not much additional learning, and I had used Bootstrap and Materialize before which also follow the grid layout. I worked on making the UI of the Metrics container, as well as wrapping the NavBar buttons with react-router Links to route to the other graphs and table.<br />
A guest speaker also came today, Laurie Voss, CTO of npm for a two hour speech on "Things You Should Know" in web development. Seeing as how universal npm is, he is kinda a big player, but in person he treats everyone as on the same level which is incredibly humble. Not to mention he speaks SUPER fast with correct pronounciation and facts. What I really liked was that he had a sense of humor and made jokes every now and then, and I'm a big fan of humor. A const and let walk into a bar and order drinks, who changes their order?
