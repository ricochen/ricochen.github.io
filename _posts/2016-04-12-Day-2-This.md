This or 'this'? 'this' is a special word in JavaScript and it is one of the most misunderstood concepts because it can mean many things. The first of which is:<br />
1) If 'this' is not bound to anything it will by default refer to the global window object known as global reference.
2) 'this' will also be bound to the global window object if used in free function invocation. A free function is any function that is not a method, in other words a function that is not bound to an object.
3) 'this' will be bound to the object left of the dot in method invocation. So in obj.someMethod, 'this' will be bound to the object obj.
4) apply, call, and bind are function methods that can explicitly make 'this' bound to a certain object. In apply, call, and bind, the first argument will be the object that 'this' refers to. So in apply(obj), call(obj), bind(obj), 'this' is bound to obj.
5) In instantiating a new object using a constructor function, 'this' will be bound to the new object.<br />
In the case of multiple ways 'this' can be bound such as setTimeout(someMethod.call(obj), 0), 'this' will be bound during invocation and in this case obj because call invokes first.
