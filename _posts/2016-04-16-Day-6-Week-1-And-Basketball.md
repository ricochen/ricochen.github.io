I didn't know it was possible to learn this much about programming until the end of my first week. It felt like a months worth of information was crammed into my brain in the timespan of 6 days. I now know for sure that I made the right choice of attending MakerSquare, than if I had taught myself.<br />
When the day ended, a number of seniors decided to play basketball at a nearby court and I decided to join thinking it would be just fun and games. Little did I know the strenuous amount of exercise I was getting myself into. They were really into the game and it ended up being the most exercise I've gotten in weeks! I have Sunday to look forward to, and plan to spend it rewriting the data structures I went over this week to make sure I can recreate them from scratch.
