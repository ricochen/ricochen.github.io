This is probably one of my favorite topics. Learning about data structures and algorithms, and then thinking about which approach to use to solve them is stimulating. It challenges my understanding of complex ways to organize data such as a hashtable or binary search tree, and ability to come up with the logic that makes the program work.<br />
My partner and I managed to create a queue and stack using functional instantiating. And tomorrow we will do the same using the other instantiation styles including functional instantiation with shared methods, prototypal instantiation, and pseudoclassical instantiation.
