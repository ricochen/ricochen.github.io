This sprint is different from the others in that it is a solo sprint. I am to choose a topic to work on for 2 days, which can be anything from a previous sprint, to the toy problems, to a new sprint using coffeesprint and backbone to create a blackjack app.<br />
A lot of people chose to redo a sprint they didn't quite finish to fully understand it. Since we learned ES6/ES2015 today, I decided to redo the data structures sprint but this time writing it in ES6 instead of ES5. The second time around was a lot easier. Knowing exactly each data structure and their purpose allowed me to go through the sub functions in a methodical way. I whiteboarded a diagram of how each function would affect a data structure in different cases then simply turned it into code.
