I didn't know how useful TypeScript was until I talked about it today at lunch with a MakerSquare fellow. I thought it was similar to CoffeeScript in which I would have to learn completely new syntax. But that's not the case, TypeScript is the closest superset to vanilla JavaScript and it pulls in features from future versions of JavaScript like ES6 and ES7. It's useful because of its optional typing system, which allows creating new data types. So along with the types string, number, object etc... one can create a new type that has certain requirements like an object that must have three properties. TypeScript makes error handling easy and is powerful when used together with Angular 2.
