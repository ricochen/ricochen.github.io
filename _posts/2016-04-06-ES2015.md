With ES2015 being the most extensive update to the JavaScript language since it was first published in 1997, I decided to spend some time learning it and new best practices. I ended up going through almost all of the material and created notes on what to use and when. I have all of the code in this [ES2015](https://github.com/ricochen/javascript-resources/blob/master/ES2015.js){:target="_blank"} file in my github. Although it is a bit lengthy, I kept it very straightforward and will show some of the material here as an example.\\
\\
<h3>let</h3>\\
\\
- instead of using var, use let

- let variables are scoped to the nearest block and are not hoisted

- A block is any code section within curly braces, like if, else, for, while etc\\
\\
function logNames(names) {
  if (names.length === 3) {
    let message = 'There are 3 names';
  } else {
    let message = 'There is not 3 names';
  }
  console.log(message);
}\\
\\
## using let in for loops

- var is the reason behind a gotcha in for loops, in which callbacks only return the last element instead of each element

- var is hoisted to the top of the function and shared across each iteration of the loop\\
\\
function logNames(names) {
  for (var i in names) {
    _loadProfile(names[i], function() {
      console.log(names[i]);
    })
  }
}

loadNames(['Max', 'Bob', 'Sam']);
//Sam
//Sam
//Sam\\
\\
#### with let theres no sharing in for loops. a new variable is created on each iteration\\
\\
function logNames(names) {
  for (let i in names) {
    _loadProfile(names[i], function() {
      console.log(names[i]);
    })
  }
}

loadNames(['Max', 'Bob', 'Sam']);
//Max
//Bob
//Sam\\
\\
### variables declared with let can be reassigned, but cannot be redeclared within the same scope\\
\\
//good
let x = 1;
x = 2;\\
\\
//bad
let x = 1;
let x = 2;
