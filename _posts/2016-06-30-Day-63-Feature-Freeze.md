Today is the last day to implement features in our app, and I'm a little relieved that it's finally over. My group and I have worked really hard during these three weeks and seeing the light at the end of the tunnel is always rewarding. The only thing left is to do some final styling as well as write tests and clean up the code base. I've also begun applying for jobs, as I had my last resume review a few days ago and will have it sent to the hiring team for hiring partners to review my candidacy. Other than that, just a week and a few more days left and bootcamp is officially over. It's been an extraordinary experience, and I can't wait to prove myself in technical interviews.
