I got into MakerSquare! It is one of the core Hack Reactor schools, with the same curriculum, schedule, and timespan as Hack Reactor. The difference is it has a smaller class size. The only bootcamps I wanted to attend were the ones with a proven reputation and teach JavaScript.

But why JavaScript?

I actually started off learning Python, but quickly switched over to JavaScript after some convincing advice from friends who were already engineers and extensive research online about each language. One of the best resources I found for choosing a programming language to learn first is this [cheat sheet](http://makeawebsitehub.com/which-programming-language/).

I think mastering JavaScript is the best way to get my foot in the door. Not only is it high in demand, but its the only programming language that runs both in the frontend and the backend, and is built into all major browsers.

As Nathan Bernard, the founder of the Lrn code-learning app said, "From the very, very back part to a database to a server, to a web interface, to a mobile native application, you can use JavaScript for every single one of those things."

I plan on attending MakerSquare, with the next cohort at April 11th and I'm going to dedicate writing a post everyday during my time at MakerSquare.
