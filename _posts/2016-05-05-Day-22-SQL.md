Structured Query Language is the de facto language for RDBMS, which stands for relational database management system. It's arguably the most popular way of interacting with a database, and relational databases are one of the most common types. The theory behind a database is that it aims to maximize time and space complexity, with some databases trading off one for the other.<br />
In RDBMS, like MySQL for example, it uses hashtables as a way to improve time complexity to constant O(1). The idea being that each column in a database is a separate hashtable, and it stores an array of indexes for a given value and updates that array during insertion. That would make inserting data into that database linear time as it needs to iterate over the entire column to update it, but allows for constant time lookup, as the value can simply be referenced by using the hashtable.
