Whew. My first day at MakerSquare may have been 12 hours, but it went by so fast. Today was spent reviewing the precourse work and coming up with optimal solutions to rewriting a few common DOM manipulation methods using recursion. Instead of recursing by calling the original function, this time I tried a different way and created a helper function inside the original function, and recursed through that. The advantage with a helper function is that it can be easier to read, and there is now a closure over the original function's variables. I feel the next few months I spend here will pass by just as fast as today, and before I know it, it will be my last day at MakerSquare.
