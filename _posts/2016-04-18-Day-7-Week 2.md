This week's sprint is based on relearning and mastering the fundamentals. It's the longest sprint consisting of 6 days, whereas data structures is the second longest with 4 days. Every other sprint is the normal length of 2 days.<br />
There is a LOT of reading. The amount of reading and video lectures combined add to a total of 24 hours, which is the first half of the sprint. The later half is spent applying the fundamentals mostly done through coding.<br />
In summary, the sprint goes over in detail 5 cores:<br />

1) Value vs reference, types, and implicit vs explicit coercion

2) Lexical scope, hoisting, compilation, execution, IIFE, closure, and modules

3) 'this', the four standard binding rules, strict mode, prototypes, shadowing, and OLOO

4) Functional programming, pure functions, and recursion

5) Asynchronous patterns, performance, async console, event loop, parallel threading, run-to-completion, concurrency, callbacks, and promises<br />

Now THAT is a lot of things to read, and one of the best resources is [You Don't Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS){:target="_blank"} by Kyle Simpson. His book is thorough, concise and contains excellent examples to learn JavaScript fundamentals.
