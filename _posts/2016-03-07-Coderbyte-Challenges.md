I finished some of the easy Coderbyte challenges, but there was one that took a bit longer:

*Letter Changes -  Replace every letter in the string with the letter following it in the alphabet (ie. c becomes d, z becomes a). Then capitalize every vowel in this new string (a, e, i, o, u) and finally return this modified string.*

I ended up using the JavaScript methods charCodeAt() and fromCharCode(), which work with Unicode, with a = 97 and z = 123.
