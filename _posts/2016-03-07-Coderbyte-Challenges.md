Coderbyte has got to be one of my favorite resources. It's surprisingly fun going through the challenges and using what I've learned to solve them. There are times where I come across ones that take a bit longer, in which I look up how to use array and string methods that I didn't know before.
For example:<br />

*Letter Changes -  Replace every letter in the string with the letter following it in the alphabet (ie. c becomes d, z becomes a). Then capitalize every vowel in this new string (a, e, i, o, u) and finally return this modified string.*<br />
I ended up using the JavaScript methods charCodeAt() and fromCharCode(), which work with Unicode, with a = 97 and z = 123.
