MakerSquare's precourse work consists of a lot of reading, which reteach the fundamentals of JavaScript, as well as three main projects that are to be submitted via a github pull request.<br /> 
Part one consists of rewriting many of the methods in the [underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/){:target="_blank"} library. A few of the later functions are tricky, but a big part of rewriting the later functions is reusing previously written functions to create abstraction, in what is known as functional programming.<br />
Part two is recreating a twitter clone, and it required knowledge of jQuery DOM manipulation. This section took me the longest as it was my first time using jQuery to link HTML elements with JavaScript. The free [jQuery Code School](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-jquery){:target="_blank"} course was a great introduction to jQuery and teaches how to traverse and work with the DOM.<br />
Part three involved rewriting a few common DOM manipulation methods using recursion. It tested both my understanding of the DOM, and the concept of recursion, which basically means calling a function on itself.<br />
With the precourse work finished, I plan to spend my remaining time before my cohort starts mastering important OOP concepts such as prototypes, encapsulation, and inheritance.
