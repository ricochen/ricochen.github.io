I can't believe how fast time has passed. Today was the seniors last day and throughout the past 5 weeks I've definitely bonded with a number of them. Who knows, down the road we might even become coworkers, which I really hope is a possibility.<br />
Monday is our MVP project which is a solo two day sprint building an app from start to finish. The idea can be anything, but oftentimes that is one of the hardest parts, coming up with a good idea. Tomorrow I'm going to brainstorm some ideas, but also make sure that it's something I can build given the limited time. Then shortly after that, I will be a senior and new juniors will come in. I'm a bit sad to see the seniors leave but also excited to meet the new juniors.
