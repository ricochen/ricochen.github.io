title: "Week 12 Career Week"

I can't believe it, I'm on the last week of bootcamp! We presented our thesis projects today to everyone, and after that we moved straight into career week. This entire week is dedicated to teaching us initial communication, application processes, and salary negotiation to help us in the job search. The instructor, Crew Spence, is an amazing lecturer and even cooler guy. After all the things he taught us, such as talking to employers about what I've done in the past, but also talk about what I can contribute, I'm excited to go through the rest of career week. I've already started applying to jobs, and I hope to do phone interviews this week to get the ball rolling. Soon enough, I'll be a software engineer at a company and this crazy adventure will finally have come to an end...except starting a new job will be an adventure in itself!
