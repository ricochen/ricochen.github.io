In the personal section of my resume, I wanted to show my interests in TV shows Suits and Silicon Valley, but couldn't think of a catchy way to. I've noticed in the past that in an interview, when the interviewer also shares my interests in common, it has led to fantastic conversations. Mainly about how awesome Harvey Spectre and Mike Ross are, or that Pied Piper is the coolest startup ever, either way I've only had positive experiences by listing them. The rest of my personal section shows more of my personality, and most importantly my humor. A quote I once heard from a very funny guy, "Life is more fun when people are laughing and smiling, that's why I always have a cheesy joke up my sleeve." -Rico Chen
