After finishing our MVP today, we had to present and demo our app to other students and the instructors. Of course, demoitis, which means an app works perfectly fine until it actually has to be demo'd then it breaks, happened to some students, including myself. My favorite was an app that allows a user to type in song lyrics, and it would fetch that song. It used YouTube's API and parsed the description to find the lyrics that were typed in.<br />
The MVP project is a great introduction to the bigger projects we will be working on. One of them is the greenfield project, which begins tomorrow and will be in a group of four. Pretty excited to hear people's ideas and choices of tech stack. Also if all four of us have different ideas and no ones willing to budge, there will be blood...just kidding, I'm sure people will compromise without having wasted too much time.
