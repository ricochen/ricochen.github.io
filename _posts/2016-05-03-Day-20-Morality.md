Everyday there is a 10 minute presentation that a student presents on a topic of their choice. Every student presents once when they're a junior, and once when they're a senior. My presentation as a junior was today, and my topic was morality.<br />
In most situations in life, people are faced with choices. Whether there are 2 choices or 10, each has a different outcome. Also, what someone thinks is a right choice, others may think is wrong. In my presentation, I presented the audience with moral dilemmas, and had people choose one of two choices, and then showed statistics from a global online poll that showed the amount of people who chose choice one and choice two. Here is an example question:
<br />
You are at your best friend’s wedding just an hour before the ceremony is to start.

Earlier that day, you came across definitive proof that your best friend’s spouse-to-be is having an affair with the best man/maid of honor, and you catch them sneaking out of a room together looking disheveled.

If you tell your friend about the affair, their day will be ruined, but you don’t want them to marry a cheater. What do you do?<br />
1)  Tell your best friend; sure the day will be ruined, but better a day ruined than an entire life.

2)  Say nothing; your job is to be supportive and participate in your friend’s happiness.
<br />
Some people who chose choice two, saw the majority of people who took the poll chose choice one, and would start to doubt their decision. However, just because more people chose a choice doesn't mean it's the right one. In fact, there is no right choice, everything is opinionated and right vs wrong will vary by person.<br />
One of the questions I was asked at the end was: "What is the underlying purpose of these moral dilemmas?" I responded saying that these questions, although not perfect, may or may not be an indicator of a person's character, and after knowing the choices they picked, hopefully now they also better understand themselves.
