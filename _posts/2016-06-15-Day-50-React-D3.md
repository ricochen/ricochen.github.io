The time has come for our app to be an MVP. It should allow the user to search words and render data visualizations based on natural language processing and sentiment analysis. I found a library called [react-d3-library](http://react-d3-library.github.io/){:target="_blank"} that makes using d3 with React easy. Instead of having to write d3 in a React component and attach props individually, the library allows writing React separately with d3, and then combines the two together in a few simple lines.<br />
d3 can then be used to its full potential through method chaining in a separate file, and can simply be exported. Then the React component can be a regular component or container with only React code and all it takes to render the d3 element is to import it and put it as a data prop on a rd3 component which comes from the react-d3-library.<br />
Before finding this library, I was a bit daunted by connecting React and d3 together, but now all I have to do is write d3 as d3 and React as React and the library will handle all the heavy lifting. Frameworks and libraries ftw!
