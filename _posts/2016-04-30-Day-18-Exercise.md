Not much to update today. I finished the rest of the data structures and compared it to the first time. My code this time was definitely less verbose. Some functions I even managed to reduce from linear O(n) time complexity because of previously using reduce, to constant O(1) by simply referencing an objects key.<br />
This seems like a good time to talk about non technical stuff! Lately I've been trying to find a new show to watch, and lucky for me a new season of Silicon Valley just came out. Looks like I know what I'm doing tomorrow. Oh and go to the gym to balance out all this mental exercise with some physical exercise!
