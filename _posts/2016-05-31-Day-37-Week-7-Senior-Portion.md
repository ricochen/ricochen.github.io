It's hard to get back into it after a week of working remote, but nonetheless today marks my first day as a senior. I did the finishing touches on the greenfield project, with writing tests in Jasmine to deploying on Heroku. [Kirk](https://github.com/ricochen/kirk){:target="_blank"} is a Siri clone that uses speech to text to fetch data for the user depending on what they say and was made with Angular on the front-end and Express/Node on the back-end.<br />
Not only was it my first day as a senior, but the new juniors arrived! Their class size is significantly larger with around 25 people. Hopefully I can provide the same guidance and friendliness that was given to me as a juinor, to them. I guess it's time to learn some names!
