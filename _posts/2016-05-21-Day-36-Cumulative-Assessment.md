Whew, I haven't had a final test like that since college. I had the entire Saturday to do it and it covered every self assessment I've done along with key concepts I've learned. The test was lengthy, with around 18 sections that each had individual coding questions and conceptual questions. I have to admit some portions were pretty hard, such as writing jasmine tests for a hash table. Nonetheless, it was beneficial because the test showed me my strengths and weaknesses. Now that it's over, I have a week of working remote on the greenfield project, and after that I'm officially a senior!
