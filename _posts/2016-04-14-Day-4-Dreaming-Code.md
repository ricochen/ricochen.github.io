It finally happened. Yesterday night I dreamt of code, and it felt so weird. It wasn't one of those super vivid dreams but real enough that I was able to move my fingers and type. Except what I typed out didn't produce what I wanted.<br />
For some reason, I was trying to solve an algorithm problem, and knew the logic to certain parts but when I went to type, it came out to be entirely different logic on the screen! Feeling confused, I tried ways to correct the block of code but everytime it would be the keys that I do not want to press, being pressed. Also, I didn't know I was in a dream so I was unable to use super powers like I do when I'm aware of being in other dreams.<br />
When I woke up, I tried putting the pieces of my dream together, and quickly realized that my keyboard was actually upside down.
