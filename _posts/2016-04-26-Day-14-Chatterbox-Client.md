With my newfound knowledge of connecting the server with the client, the current sprint involved creating a simple chat app. This app would retrieve messages from other users from the server and appear in the front end, as well as allow each user to send messages. Users could create their own chat rooms and exit and enter different chat rooms at any given time. To be frank, there were some pretty funny conversations going on in some of the chat rooms. Thanks to the reminder app, which was a previous sprint, using ajax to make GET and POST requests, and connecting the front end to the back end was more straighforward.
