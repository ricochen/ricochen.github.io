title: "Week 9 React YouTube and Books App"
date: 2016-06-13

I went through most of the Udemy video series on React and Redux, stopping at Redux middleware and async actions. In the process, I made a React app that uses the YouTube search API and retrieves videos from YouTube based on the input of the user. Alongside making a React and Redux app that shows the details of a list of books and allows the user to switch between the current book. By following the video series slowly, and writing the code at the same time, I really obtained a strong understanding of using the two together. The bindActionCreator, connect, and combineReducer modules make sense to me now, and I understand what they return. I'm also able to follow the lifecycle of a component, and use mapStateToProps and mapStateToDispatch to obtain state in a container and pass along actions to reducers. Although, when I apply what I learned to the thesis project, it becomes difficult as I no longer have an awesome video to walk me through. But baby steps, and small additions and refactors here and there and sooner or later everything will be clear.
