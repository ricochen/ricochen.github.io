Planning out a simple schema and writing the create table statements in an SQL file is the easy part. The hard part comes with creating the database and making sure the relationships are correct between tables. Specifically, including a foreign key to a table. To achieve this requires a callback that references the lastID of the recent record, which will be used as the foreign key for the current record. lastID is a property on the 'this' object that a Database#run statement returns in the callback.<br />
For example, with an INSERT INTO on a customers table that has no foreign keys, another INSERT INTO for a product table that uses customers primary key as its foreign key would need to be nested inside the initial INSERT INTO's customers table callback.<br />
With the database and tables created, and the records inserted normalized into the tables, a separate file can be used to run reports. This file can be used for something as simple as a select statement with one column, to a left join of two tables. The purpose being to display only the necessary data in a formatted manner, whenever someone needs it. That is the power of databases.
