I've decided. This is what I want to do. From learning using online resources to practicing algorithms, I've come to love programming. There's no better feeling than seeing my code come to life after endless fixes. What I also love is how challenging programming can be, and that I'm always learning as new technologies and frameworks are created. At this point, there are two possible routes I can take:


1) Go to a 12 week coding bootcamp \\
2) Self teach


I think I'm going to do both. Learn on my own and apply to the two bootcamps that I've narrowed it down to. If I get in, there is a high chance I will attend to accelerate my learning as well as learn best practices and how to work with others.


I'm excited, and somewhat glad I made this decision early on in my career. Either way, I'm back at square one and it's going to be a long but fun journey.
