We had our first guest speaker come in today to talk about refactoring, and for him to take time out of his schedule to voluntarily teach us really shows how passionate some engineers are about the industry. To summarize, he touched upon two key points in refactoring: Rename method and extract method.<br />
Use names that are declarative! Whether it's for a variable, function, method or whatever, try to choose a name that is self explanatory. This will greatly improve readability for others.<br />
Don't repeat yourself, or DRY. If the same block of code is being used in multiple places, that can be an indication to extract it out into it's own function. So in the future if changes ever need to be made, there is a single source of truth, and the function can be changed, but still be invoked the same way in place of the original block of code.
